## 📚 Background  
This repository contains the basic code to perform **Quantization** on the **VGG16** architecture trained on the **CIFAR-10** dataset.  
You can change the **quantization bits** of both the **weights** and **activations**, and evaluate model performance **before** and **after** quantization.
